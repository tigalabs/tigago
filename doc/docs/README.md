Dija Altman was a super ancient giant of light who came to the earth from Orion 30 million years ago. However, after he came to the earth, he degenerated into a dark giant for unknown reasons. After eliminating the monster, dark diga and his three dark companions defeated all the giants to dominate the super ancient world.
